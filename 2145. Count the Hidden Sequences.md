# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def numberOfArrays(self, differences: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> int:
        possible_hidden = [0]

        for i, diff in enumerate(differences):
            possible_hidden.append(possible_hidden[i] + diff)
        
        max_val = -1
        min_val = 1e9

        for num in possible_hidden:
            max_val = max(max_val, num)
            min_val = min(min_val, num)

        ammount_to_min = lower - min_val

        if max_val + ammount_to_min <= upper:
            return upper - (max_val + ammount_to_min) + 1
        else:
            return 0
