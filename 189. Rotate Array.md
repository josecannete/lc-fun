# 189. Rotate Array

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We divide the string in two groups, then we concatenate those.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        k = k % len(nums)
        nums[:] = nums[len(nums)-k:len(nums)] + nums[0:len(nums)-k]
```

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Here we also divide in two groups, but instead of using extra memory, we use reverse as technique. We start by reversing the entire array, and then we reverse each of the parts, so the first part (until k) and then from k to the end of the array.

This solution traverses the string two times, but remains O(n) and using O(1) extra space, since dont need a copy of the array, we just use another variable to swap when reversing the array.

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```python3 []
def reverse(arr, left, right):
    while left < right:
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        k = k % len(nums)

        reverse(nums, 0, len(nums)-1)
        reverse(nums, 0, k-1)
        reverse(nums, k, len(nums)-1)
```
