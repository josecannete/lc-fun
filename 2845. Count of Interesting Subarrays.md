# 2845. Count of Interesting Subarrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-interesting-subarrays/

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

My first intuition was to use prefix sums and brute force. We are looking for each starting index i, which are the ending indexes j that satisfy that the sum between those % modulo equals k.

This approach didn't work since the complexity is O(n^2).

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

Instead of that, we use modulo arithmetic.
Note that these two comparison are the same.
```
if (acc_sum[j] - acc_sum[i-1]) % modulo == k:
if (acc_sum[j] - k + modulo) % modulo ==  acc_sum[i-1] % modulo
```

Instead of iterate though i and j. We look for the ammount of i that satisfy the condition with each j (each ending index).

To do that, we save in a dict as we iterate.

The two solutions are present in the following code (the commented one is the brute force).


# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def countInterestingSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], modulo: int, k: int) -> int:
        nums = [num % modulo == k for num in nums]
        acc_sum = [0 for i in range(len(nums)+1)]

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            acc_sum[i+1] = acc_sum[i] + num

        cnt = 0

        #for i in range(1, len(acc_sum)):
        #    for j in range(i, len(acc_sum)):
                #if (acc_sum[j] - acc_sum[i-1]) % modulo == k:
                    #cnt += 1
                # this is the same as (modulo arithmetic)
                #if (acc_sum[j] - k + modulo) % modulo ==  acc_sum[i-1] % modulo:
                 #   cnt += 1

        prefix_cnt = {}

        for i in range(1, len(acc_sum)):
            prefix_cnt[acc_sum[i-1] % modulo] = prefix_cnt.get(acc_sum[i-1] % modulo, 0) + 1
            cnt += prefix_cnt.get((acc_sum[i] - k + modulo) % modulo, 0)   
        

        return cnt
        
```
