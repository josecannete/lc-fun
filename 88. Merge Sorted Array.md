# 88. Merge Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

The idea is to combine the two sorted arrays in such a way that the result remains sorted.

The first idea that came to me was to have two pointers, and traverse them both by looking which is the minimum of both, and push that value into a new array. In the end, that array will be sorted as well. I've also noted that the cases where some of the arrays is empty should be handled.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

Instead of that route, which used new memory (a new array), the idea was to modify nums1 in-place. A thing to note is that the last part of nums1 was full of zeroes. We know that the greater values will use those places, so instead of starting from the lesser values, we will start by the greater values and modify nums1 in those corresponding places.

We will have three pointers, one for nums1 (starts at m - 1), one for nums2 (starts at n - 1) and one for the place in the array to write the new value (starts at m + n - 1). Those -1 are necessary since we index from 0.


# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n+m)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        write_pointer = m + n - 1
        first_pointer = m - 1
        second_pointer = n - 1

        for _ in range(0, n+m):
            if first_pointer < 0:
                nums1[write_pointer] = nums2[second_pointer]
                second_pointer -= 1
            elif second_pointer < 0:
                nums1[write_pointer] = nums1[first_pointer]
                first_pointer -= 1
            elif nums1[first_pointer] > nums2[second_pointer]:
                nums1[write_pointer] = nums1[first_pointer]
                first_pointer -= 1
            else:
                nums1[write_pointer] = nums2[second_pointer]
                second_pointer -=1

            write_pointer -= 1

        
```
